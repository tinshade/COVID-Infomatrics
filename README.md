# COVID-Infomatrics

An **Indian** Infomatrics website for the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic.
In these rough times, every nations needs all the help they can possibly get and as a developer with
somewhat free time on my hands, I thought why not make something helpful.

I can do better but I lack time due to academic pressure and my learning schedules during this quarantine
period. Yes, there is no quarantine break when you are a developer.

## Future Plans
1. Shift to React/Django 
2. Tweet Search based on location and Hashtag
3. NodeJS/Python Map plotting and visualization for local map display on the website
